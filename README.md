# Tech_AI_Team: AI Agents for Construction Safety Content & Compliance

## Overview

Tech_AI_Team is a multi-agent system built with Google‚Äôs Agent Development Kit (ADK) to enhance construction site safety using AI. It automates content generation, ensures regulatory compliance, adapts content for global audiences, performs safety risk assessments, and can even produce voice-over scripts. This project was developed for the **Google Cloud Multi-Agent Hackathon 2024**.

## üîß Key Use Case

Our system ingests incident and observation reports from construction sites and produces:

- OSHA/ISO-compliant safety content (e.g., Instagram posts, scripts)
- Context-aware voice-over scripts
- Cultural-localized safety messaging
- Safety risk assessments
- Usability feedback
- Learning analytics based on worker interaction
- Content reviewed for regulatory compliance and tone

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent Limitations

| Agent                      | Limitations                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DataEngineerAgent         | Simulated feed only; not connected to live site sensors                    |
| ContentCreationAgent      | May produce generic phrases; relies on input quality                       |
| ComplianceCheckerAgent    | Flags issues but does not provide legal certification                      |
| VoiceOverAgent            | Generates text scripts only; no real-time voice synthesis                  |
| TranslatorAgent           | Relies on LLM quality; idioms may translate poorly                         |
| RiskAssessmentAgent       | Not a full safety audit; identifies common risks from prompts              |
| AudienceAnalysisAgent     | Assumes default traits if metadata is lacking                              |
| ContentLocalizationAgent  | Cultural context limited to language model knowledge                       |
| UsabilityTestingAgent     | Simulated testing; does not include actual user interviews                 |
| LearningAnalyticsAgent    | Uses mock interaction data unless integrated with a front-end              |
| StyleToneAnalysisAgent    | Operates on heuristic rules and may misjudge nuanced tone                  |
